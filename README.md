# Data Analysis Results

The question I asked is where are the most expensive homes found?
Using this program, I was able to find out that the state with the
most expensive homes from this dataset was Massachusetts. Out of the
60 most expensive listings, MA had 31 of them (or over half!!).

The runners up are Puerto Rico with 15, Virgin Islands with 4, New York
and Conneticut with 4 each, and New Hampshire with 1. I also found
information about the lowest pricing homes on the market.

The second question I asked was how do housing prices vary by state?
I solved this by adding a "search by state" function that searches
for prices by each state. It first reproduces the highest and lowest
10 listings for the state. Finally, It shows the mean or average
listing price of that state.

I was curious about the type of listings you might find in the state
of Massachusetts. I ran it through that method, and I found out some
interesting things about the state. First of all, The most expensive
homes listed in MA are up to 30 million dollars! The cheapest listings
can be below 10 thousand dollars (super cheap!!). Did you know the 
average listing price in MA is $985,542? That's almost a million
dollars!
